# SublimeAutoHotkey - Syntax Package for Sublime Text 2/3
AutoHotkey AHK language package for SublimeText including syntax highlighting, comments toggling, auto-completions, build system definitions, commands for ahkrun, ahkcompile, ahkrunpiped.

## Package Installation
* Manual method: Download ZIP from github. Extract the files to [Sublime_Data_Dir](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/basic_concepts.html#the-data-directory)\Packages\AutoHotkey
* Automatic method: Install [AutoHotKey](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/AutoHotkey) with Package Control.

## Key Bindings
If you have the default Sublime keybindings intact, then:
* <kbd>Ctrl+B</kbd> will run the current file (with AutoHotkey.exe)
* <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+B</kbd> will compile the current file (with Ahk2Exe.exe)

## Advanced Configuration
For the build system and ahkrun, ahkrunpiped, and ahkcompile commands, if you have a non-default installation then you will need to set your specific path to AutoHotkey.exe and Ahk2Exe.exe in a file named AutoHotkey.sublime-settings in your User folder. You can access these settings file from the Menu `Preferences > Package Settings > AutoHotkey`. You should make a copy of `AutoHotkey Settings - Default` at `AutoHotkey Settings - User` and modify there since then any settings defined in your User folder will take precedence and the package can still update itself without overwriting your custom settings.

## ahkrunpiped
The ahkrunpiped command will allow you to run your code as a piped text string to AutoHotkey (this allows you to run snippets of code without having to save them to a file):
* If text is selected - ahkrunpiped will pipe and run the selected text only.
* If no text is selected - ahkrunpiped will pipe and run the entire contents of the current document.

## Goto-documentation Integration
Now press F1 hotkey will take you to documentation for word under cursor.
